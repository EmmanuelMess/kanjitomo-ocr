# Default test definitions
#
# Each line starts with a filename (located in "default images" folder),
# followed by tab-delimited list of tests. 
#
# Each test contains comma-delimited list of parameters.
#
# Area tests contain parameters:
# - x,y			 = upper-left corner of target character or column 
# - width,height = character or column dimensions
#
# OCR tests contain parameters:
# - x,y			= target character coordinates (anywhere within character's borders)
# - character   = target character
#
# These tests and target images are committed to GitHub. 
# If you have tests that are not meant to be committed, define your tests at "local.txt" file 
# and add images to "local images" directory
